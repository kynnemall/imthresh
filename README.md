# imthresh
Threshold single channels from BGR and HSV images

## Why another image viewer?
* I was working on a computer vision project which required good masks and I needed a simple app to examine masks and images to find the optimal thresholds in both RGB and HSV images
* This would have taken alot of trial and error in a Jupyter Notebook
* Streamlit makes it easy to quickly test different threshold values and examine the results interactively
