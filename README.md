# imthresh
A simple app to threshold single channels in RGB and HSV images

## Why another image viewer?
* I was working on a computer vision project which required good masks
* I needed a simple app to find optimal thresholds for channel masks in both RGB and HSV images
* This would have taken alot of trial and error in a Jupyter Notebook
* Streamlit made it easy to quickly test different threshold values and examine the results interactively
* Quickly check threshold performance across multiple images

## How to use
1. Upload images
2. Adjust slider limits for each channel
3. Check how limits affect other images
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until happy with the results
4. ???
5. Profit!
